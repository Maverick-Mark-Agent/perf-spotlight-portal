# SMA Insurance Commission Tracking - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented commission tracking features exclusively for SMA Insurance workspace. These features allow tracking multiple policies per lead with automatic commission calculations.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Multiple Policies Per Lead
- Each lead can have multiple insurance policies
- Each policy tracks:
  - Policy Type (Auto, Home, Life, Commercial, Health, Umbrella, Other)
  - Premium Amount
  - Agency Commission (SMA Insurance)
  - Maverick Commission (auto-calculated as 20% of Agency Commission)

### 2. Commission KPI Cards
Three new KPI cards replace the standard 4 cards for SMA Insurance workspace:
- **Total Premium Closed** - Sum of all policy premiums (all-time)
- **Total Commission to SMA** - Sum of all agency commissions (all-time)
- **Total Commission to Maverick** - Sum of Maverick commissions (20% of SMA)

### 3. Enhanced Won Lead Workflow
When marking a lead as Won in SMA Insurance workspace:
- Custom dialog appears for entering multiple policies
- Can add/remove policies dynamically
- Real-time calculation of Maverick commission (20%)
- Summary shows totals across all policies

### 4. Lead Detail Modal Enhancements
For SMA Insurance leads:
- Policies section displays all associated policies in a table
- Summary cards show totals for that specific lead
- Can delete individual policies
- Standard premium/policy fields hidden (replaced by policies)

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema

**New Table: `sma_policies`**
```sql
CREATE TABLE sma_policies (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  lead_id UUID REFERENCES client_leads(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  workspace_name TEXT (must equal 'SMA Insurance'),
  policy_type TEXT NOT NULL,
  premium_amount DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
  agency_commission DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
  maverick_commission DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL, -- Auto-calculated
  created_at TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

**Triggers:**
- Auto-update `updated_at` on row changes
- Auto-calculate `maverick_commission` as 20% of `agency_commission`

**Constraints:**
- `workspace_name` must equal 'SMA Insurance'
- Foreign key cascade delete (deleting lead deletes all policies)
- Check constraints ensure positive amounts

### Code Architecture

**New Components:**
1. `SMACommissionKPICards.tsx` - 3 KPI cards with aggregated commission data
2. `SMAPoliciesInputDialog.tsx` - Multi-policy input form for won leads
3. `SMAPoliciesList.tsx` - Policies table display in lead detail modal

**New Services:**
1. `smaPoliciesService.ts` - CRUD operations for policies
   - `createPolicies()` - Create multiple policies for a lead
   - `getPoliciesByLeadId()` - Fetch all policies for a lead
   - `deletePolicy()` - Remove a policy
   - `getSMACommissionSummary()` - Get all-time totals for KPI cards
   - `getLeadCommissionSummary()` - Get totals for specific lead

**New Types:**
1. `sma.ts` - TypeScript interfaces for policies and commission summaries

**Modified Components:**
1. `ClientPortalPage.tsx`
   - Conditional rendering of SMA KPI cards
   - Conditional SMA policies dialog
   - Handler for saving multiple policies
2. `LeadDetailModal.tsx`
   - Conditional policies section for SMA workspace
   - Hide standard premium fields for SMA

### Conditional Logic

All SMA features are controlled by a single condition:
```typescript
workspace === "SMA Insurance"
```

This ensures:
- Zero impact on other workspaces
- Easy to extend to other commission-based clients
- Maintainable and testable code

## User Experience Flow

### Scenario 1: Adding a Won Deal (Multiple Policies)

1. User drags lead to "Won" column
2. **SMA Policies Dialog** appears
3. User enters first policy:
   - Policy Type: Auto Insurance
   - Premium: $2,500
   - Agency Commission: $375
   - *Maverick Commission auto-shows: $75.00*
4. User clicks "Add Another Policy"
5. User enters second policy:
   - Policy Type: Home Insurance
   - Premium: $4,500
   - Agency Commission: $675
   - *Maverick Commission auto-shows: $135.00*
6. **Deal Summary** shows:
   - Total Premium: $7,000
   - Total SMA Commission: $1,050
   - Total Maverick Commission: $210.00
7. User clicks "Save 2 Policies"
8. Lead moves to Won
9. **KPI cards update** with new totals

### Scenario 2: Viewing Lead Policies

1. User clicks on won lead (e.g., "John Doe")
2. **Lead Detail Modal** opens
3. **Policies section** displays:
   - Table with all policies
   - Each row shows: Type, Premium, Agency Commission, Maverick Commission
   - Summary cards at bottom with totals
4. User can delete policy if needed
5. Modal updates summary in real-time

### Scenario 3: Tracking Commissions (Dashboard View)

1. User navigates to SMA Insurance workspace
2. Sees **3 KPI cards** at top:
   - Total Premium Closed: $23,200
   - Total Commission to SMA: $3,480
   - Total Commission to Maverick: $696.00
3. Cards provide at-a-glance commission overview
4. Updates automatically when policies added/deleted

---

## Data Validation

### Business Rules Enforced

1. **Maverick Commission**: Always exactly 20% of Agency Commission
   - Enforced by database trigger
   - Cannot be manually overridden
   - Calculated to 2 decimal places

2. **Workspace Constraint**: Policies only for SMA Insurance
   - Database check constraint
   - UI conditional rendering
   - Service layer validation

3. **Required Fields** (when creating policy):
   - Policy Type (must be selected)
   - Premium Amount (must be > 0)
   - Agency Commission (must be >= 0)

4. **Cascade Delete**: Deleting lead removes all policies
   - Foreign key constraint with ON DELETE CASCADE
   - Prevents orphaned policy records

---

## Performance Considerations

### Optimizations
1. **Indexed Columns**: `lead_id`, `workspace_name`, `created_at`
2. **Aggregate Queries**: Single query for KPI summaries
3. **Conditional Rendering**: SMA components only load when needed
4. **Auto-Calculation**: Database triggers handle commission math

### Scalability
- Can handle thousands of policies without performance impact
- KPI cards fetch aggregates (not individual records)
- Policies loaded only when viewing specific lead

---

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests (Recommended)
- Service functions (CRUD operations)
- Commission calculation accuracy
- Form validation

### Integration Tests (Recommended)
- End-to-end won lead flow
- Policy creation and deletion
- KPI card data accuracy

### Manual Testing Checklist
- ✅ SMA KPI cards show correct totals
- ✅ Can add multiple policies to won lead
- ✅ Maverick commission calculates correctly (20%)
- ✅ Policies display in lead detail modal
- ✅ Can delete policies
- ✅ Other workspaces unaffected
- ✅ Database migration succeeds

---

## Deployment Plan
