## Overview
Training session for Maddie on the Maverick Marketing dashboard and lead management workflow for insurance agency operations.

## Key Decisions
- Maddie will primarily work in the `maverickmarketingllc.com` dashboard (client portal view)
- Email workflow established: Maria (AI) sends initial replies, then transitions to Maddie by CC'ing her

- Maddie will act as Maria in initial correspondence, then introduce herself on follow-ups

## Action Items
- [ ] **Maddie**: Familiarize with dashboard interface and lead filtering
