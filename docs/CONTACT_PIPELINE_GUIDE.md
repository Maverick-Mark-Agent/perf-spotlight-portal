## Monthly Workflow

### Step 1: Upload Cole X Dates CSV (15th of Month)
On the 15th of each month, upload next month's CSV file:

1. Navigate to Contact Pipeline Dashboard
2. Click "Upload CSV"
3. Select workspace (client)
4. Select month (format: 2025-11)
5. Choose CSV file from Cole X Dates
6. Click "Upload & Process"

**What Happens:**
- CSV parsed and validated
- Head of Household filter applied
- Home value criteria checked
- Invalid emails removed
- Purchase dates parsed
- Contacts stored in `raw_contacts`

**Expected Results:**
- ~15,000 contacts for 100-lead tier
- ~30,000 contacts for 200-lead tier
- ~10-20% filtered out
- Status: ready_for_verification

### Step 2: Verify Emails (Automatic)
After upload completes, verification runs automatically:

**Process:**
- Batches of 100 emails sent to Debounce API
- Rate limited to avoid overwhelming API
- Runs in background (may take 10-30 minutes)

**What's Calculated:**
- Email deliverability status
- Purchase day (1-31)
- Renewal start date (M+28 days)
- Renewal end date (M+34 days)
- Week bucket assignment (1-4)

**Expected Results:**
- ~85-90% deliverable
- ~10-15% undeliverable/risky
- All verified contacts ready for batching

### Step 3: Generate Weekly Batches (Automatic)
After verification completes:

**Process:**
- Identifies all Mondays in the month
- Groups contacts by week bucket
- Creates 4 batch records
- Generates CSV files
- Schedules uploads

**Week Bucket Logic:**
- **Bucket 1** (Week 1): Purchase days 1-7 â†’ 1st Monday
- **Bucket 2** (Week 2): Purchase days 8-14 â†’ 2nd Monday
- **Bucket 3** (Week 3): Purchase days 15-21 â†’ 3rd Monday
- **Bucket 4** (Week 4): Purchase days 22-31 â†’ 4th Monday

**Expected Results:**
- 4 batches created per client
- ~25% of contacts per batch
- Status: pending

## Weekly Workflow

### Monday Morning: Slack Notification (8 AM)
Every Monday at 8 AM, team receives Slack notification:

**Message Includes:**
- List of all batches scheduled for today
- Client name, week number, contact count
- Standard vs HNW breakdown
- Batch ID for approval

**Team Action Required:**
- Review contact counts
- Verify clients are correct
- Approve each batch via slash command

### Approve Batch (Via Slack)
To approve a batch:

1. Copy batch ID from notification
2. Reply in Slack: `/approve-batch <batch_id>`
3. Wait for confirmation (30 seconds - 2 minutes)

**What Happens After Approval:**
1. Batch marked as approved (records approver + timestamp)
2. Upload function triggered automatically
3. Contacts uploaded to Email Bison
4. Added to Evergreen campaigns
5. Campaigns renamed with renewal dates
6. Confirmation posted to Slack

**Expected Duration:**
- Small batches (<1000 contacts): 1-2 minutes
- Large batches (>2000 contacts): 3-5 minutes

### Upload Results
After successful upload:

**Standard Contacts:**
- Uploaded to "Evergreen" campaign
- Campaign renamed: "Evergreen 2025-12-01 to 2025-12-07"
- Contacts added to existing campaign

**High Net Worth Contacts (TX >$900k):**
- Uploaded to "HNW Evergreen" campaign
- Campaign renamed: "HNW Evergreen 2025-12-01 to 2025-12-07"
- Separate from standard contacts

**Audit Trail:**
- All operations logged to `upload_audit_log`
- API requests/responses stored
- Duration and credits tracked

## Monitoring & Alerts

### Key Metrics to Track

1. **Upload Success Rate**
   - Target: >95% of batches uploaded successfully
   - Alert if: <90% success rate

2. **Verification Rate**
   - Target: >85% deliverable emails
   - Alert if: <80% deliverable

3. **Target Achievement**
   - Target: 100% of monthly contact quota
   - Alert if: <80% by 20th of month

4. **Debounce Credit Usage**
   - Budget: $500/month for 1M credits
   - Alert if: >80% credits used before month end

5. **Batch Approval Delays**
   - Target: All batches approved within 1 hour of notification
   - Alert if: Batch pending >4 hours

### Audit Queries

**Check today's batch status:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM weekly_batch_status
WHERE scheduled_upload_date = CURRENT_DATE;
```

**Find failed uploads:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM upload_audit_log
WHERE status = 'failed'
  AND performed_at >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '7 days'
ORDER BY performed_at DESC;
```

**Debounce usage this month:**
```sql
SELECT
  workspace_name,
  SUM(credits_used) AS total_credits,
  SUM(emails_verified) AS total_emails,
  AVG(deliverable_count::FLOAT / emails_verified * 100) AS avg_deliverable_rate
FROM debounce_usage
WHERE month = TO_CHAR(CURRENT_DATE, 'YYYY-MM')
GROUP BY workspace_name;
```

**Gap analysis (clients behind target):**
```sql
SELECT
  client_display_name,
  monthly_contact_target,
  verified_contacts,
  contacts_needed,
  target_percentage
FROM monthly_contact_pipeline_summary
WHERE month = TO_CHAR(CURRENT_DATE, 'YYYY-MM')
  AND target_percentage < 80
ORDER BY target_percentage;
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: CSV Upload Fails
**Symptoms:** Error message when uploading CSV

**Causes:**
1. Invalid CSV format (missing columns)
2. Workspace not found in client_registry
3. Invalid month format

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Check CSV has all 13 required columns
# Expected headers:
# First Name, Last Name, Mailing Address, Mailing City, Mailing State, Mailing ZIP,
# Property Address, Property City, Property State, Property ZIP,
# Home Value Estimate, Purchase Date, Email

# Verify client exists
SELECT * FROM client_registry WHERE workspace_name = 'Client Name';

# Check month format (must be YYYY-MM)
# Correct: 2025-11
# Wrong: 11-2025, November 2025
```

### Issue: Email Verification Stuck
**Symptoms:** Contacts stuck in ready_for_verification status

**Causes:**
1. Debounce API key invalid
2. Rate limit exceeded
3. Function timeout

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Verify Debounce API key
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $DEBOUNCE_API_KEY" https://api.debounce.io/v1/status

# Check function logs
npx supabase functions logs verify-contacts-debounce --tail 50

# Retry verification manually
curl -X POST https://your-project.supabase.co/functions/v1/verify-contacts-debounce \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SERVICE_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"workspace_name": "Client Name", "month": "2025-11"}'
```

### Issue: Batch Upload Fails
**Symptoms:** Batch status = failed

**Causes:**
1. Email Bison workspace not found
2. Campaign not found
3. API timeout

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Check batch details
SELECT * FROM weekly_batches WHERE batch_id = 'uuid';

# Check audit log for error
SELECT * FROM upload_audit_log
WHERE batch_id = 'uuid'
  AND action = 'bison_upload'
ORDER BY performed_at DESC LIMIT 1;

# Retry upload manually
curl -X POST https://your-project.supabase.co/functions/v1/upload-to-email-bison \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SERVICE_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"batch_id": "uuid"}'
```

### Issue: Slack Notifications Not Received
**Symptoms:** No notification on Monday morning

**Causes:**
1. Cron job not running
2. No batches scheduled for today
3. Slack webhook invalid

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Check cron job status
SELECT * FROM cron.job WHERE jobname = 'slack-notify-weekly-batches';

# Check for pending batches
SELECT * FROM weekly_batches
WHERE scheduled_upload_date = CURRENT_DATE
  AND bison_upload_status = 'pending'
  AND slack_notification_sent = false;

# Test Slack webhook
curl -X POST $SLACK_VOLUME_WEBHOOK_URL \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "Test notification"}'

# Manually trigger notification
curl -X POST https://your-project.supabase.co/functions/v1/slack-notify-weekly-batch \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SERVICE_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
