# Maverick X Cap Insurance Check-In
**Date:** February 10, 2026
**Time:** ~4:00 PM CST
**Duration:** ~28 minutes
**Participants:** Thomas (Maverick Marketing), Charlie (Cap Insurance Group)

## Overview
Client check-in call to discuss campaign restart with new sender names, hiring licensed VA for lead management, and future expansion plans.

## Key Decisions

### Campaign Restart
- **Switching ALL sender names from Kim/Maria to Beth** - launching Feb 11th
- Decided to do full switch instead of gradual 10% batches (logistical simplification)
- Beth is an actual person on Cap's team (legitimizes the campaign vs. fictional sender)
- Will reach out to March contacts instead of continuing February (due to workflow change)

### Sales Team Structure
- **Hiring Alex** - licensed insurance VA based in El Salvador (US citizen/resident)
- Alex will handle Cap Insurance leads exclusively (not shared with other clients)
- Alex previously worked at Sirius XM calling 600 people/day - experienced with high-volume outreach
- Commercial insurance expansion postponed until Alex masters personal lines workflow

### Lead Management Workflow
- Alex will manage full lead cycle: initial reply → phone outreach → quoting
- Will work from dashboard, doctor AI-generated replies, then reach out via email + phone
- Must CC Beth email on every reply to maintain thread continuity
- Target: 70%+ quote rate (benchmark from agencies with dedicated lead handlers)

## Action Items

### Immediate (This Week)
- [x] **Thomas**: Launch campaign with Beth sender name - **Feb 11th**
- [ ] **Charlie**: Send Alex's email address via Slack for system access
- [ ] **Thomas**: Add Alex to Slack workspace
- [ ] **Thomas**: Add Alex to dashboard with appropriate permissions
- [ ] **Thomas**: Add Alex to back-end system

### Next Week
- [ ] **Thomas**: Training call with Alex - **Monday, Feb 16th at 1:30 PM Central (2:30 PM Eastern)**
- [ ] **Charlie**: Train Alex on lead handling best practices
- [ ] **Charlie**: Ensure current client list is scrubbed to avoid duplicate outreach

### Future Planning
- [ ] **Thomas**: Book for April/May expansion (best season for insurance leads)
- [ ] **Charlie**: Consider commercial insurance campaign once personal lines is optimized
- [ ] **Charlie**: Consider adding second licensed VA for commercial lines

## Important Notes

### Campaign Performance Context
- Historical quote rates: 70%+ when dedicated teams handle leads
- Spring (April/May) = highest volume + best close rates
- Commercial campaigns: 4-5% reply rate with 60-70% interested rate
- Trucking campaigns: 10% reply rate (StreetSmart example: $5M premium in 8 months)

### Client List Issues
- 4-5 current Cap clients were accidentally hit in recent campaign
- All were high-net-worth clients (good targeting, bad execution)
- **Critical**: Must maintain scrubbed client list going forward

### Cost Comparison
- Maverick is 400% cheaper than next cheapest lead source per client's lead consultant
- Consultant manages spend for 4 other Maverick clients with similar results

## Strategic Opportunities Discussed
- **Commercial insurance**: High value, slower sales cycle, needs dedicated VA
- **Geographic expansion**: Raleigh and other markets available
- **Increased spend**: More volume available if mousetrap works with Alex
- **Lead consultant intro**: Thomas mentioned contact who helps agencies optimize lead spend

## Follow-Up Schedule
- **Feb 16th, 1:30 PM Central**: Alex training call
- Regular check-ins every 2 weeks for first month (TBD)

## Thomas's Notes for Alex Training
- Show dashboard navigation and reply workflow
- Explain AI-generated reply editing process
- Emphasize importance of CC'ing Beth on all replies
- Review phone outreach timing and scripting
- Walk through quote preparation workflow
