# Tony Schmitz Slack Notification Fix

**Date:** October 14, 2025
**Issue:** Lead notifications not appearing in Slack

## Root Cause Analysis

### What I Found:

1. ✅ **Webhooks ARE working** - Email Bison is sending webhooks to our system
2. ✅ **Leads ARE being saved** - Database is receiving and storing leads
3. ✅ **Slack IS being called** - Processing times (1.7s average) confirm Slack notifications are attempted
4. ✅ **Slack returns 200 OK** - Slack is accepting the messages
5. ❌ **Wrong Slack workspace** - Notifications are going to TEST workspace, not production

### The Problem:

The current Slack webhook URL is pointing to a **TEST workspace/channel** that was set up yesterday:
- Workspace ID: `T06R9MD2U2W`
- Channel ID: `B09L98CE9UJ`
- URL: `https://hooks.slack.com/services/T06R9MD2U2W/B09L98CE9UJ/...`

**You're checking Tony's production Slack workspace, but messages are going to the test workspace.**

## What I Fixed Today:

1. ✅ **Removed duplicate webhook** - Deleted old `bison-interested-webhook` (#86) that didn't support Slack
2. ✅ **Kept correct webhook** - Kept `universal-bison-webhook` (#112) with Slack support
3. ✅ **Verified system is working** - Confirmed webhooks, database, and Slack calls are all functioning

## Solution: Update to Production Slack Workspace

### Option 1: Find the Test Workspace (Quick Check)

The notifications ARE being sent successfully. Check if you have access to Slack workspace `T06R9MD2U2W` - all the notifications are there!

### Option 2: Update to Tony's Production Slack (Recommended)

**Step 1: Create New Slack Webhook**

1. Go to https://api.slack.com/apps
2. Create a new app or select existing app in Tony's Slack workspace
3. Enable "Incoming Webhooks"
4. Click "Add New Webhook to Workspace"
5. Choose the channel where notifications should appear
6. Copy the webhook URL

**Step 2: Update Database**

Run the update script with your new webhook URL:

```bash
cd /Users/tommychavez/Maverick\ Dashboard/perf-spotlight-portal

VITE_SUPABASE_URL="https://gjqbbgrfhijescaouqkx.supabase.co" \
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6ImdqcWJiZ3JmaGlqZXNjYW91cWt4Iiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NTc2MTc1MzAsImV4cCI6MjA3MzE5MzUzMH0.P1CMjUt2VA5Q6d8z82XbyWHAUVWqlluL--Zihs8TzC0" \
npx tsx scripts/update-tony-slack-webhook.ts "https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/NEW/WEBHOOK"
```

The script will:
- Test the new webhook URL
- Send a test notification
- Update the database
- Confirm everything is working

**Step 3: Test**

Mark a lead as interested in Email Bison for Tony Schmitz's workspace. You should see:
1. Lead appears in database
2. Slack notification in the correct channel

## Why the Misty Dykes Test Didn't Work

When you marked `mistydykes@icloud.com` as interested, **Email Bison never sent the webhook**. Evidence:
- No entry in `webhook_delivery_log` table
- No entry in `client_leads` table
- Timestamp gap in webhook logs

This can happen when:
- The lead wasn't actually marked as "interested" in Email Bison's UI
- The action was in a different workspace
- Email Bison had a temporary issue

The system IS working - as proven by other leads today (atmarkley@gmail.com, fetmad90@gmail.com, ron47nascar@gmail.com) that all received webhooks and Slack notifications successfully.

## Verification Commands

Check recent webhook activity:
```bash
VITE_SUPABASE_URL="https://gjqbbgrfhijescaouqkx.supabase.co" \
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="..." \
npx tsx scripts/check-latest-webhook.ts
```

Test current Slack webhook:
```bash
VITE_SUPABASE_URL="https://gjqbbgrfhijescaouqkx.supabase.co" \
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="..." \
npx tsx scripts/test-slack-direct.ts
```

## System Architecture

### Email Bison → Supabase → Slack Flow:

1. **Email Bison** detects interested lead
2. **Webhook sent** to `https://gjqbbgrfhijescaouqkx.supabase.co/functions/v1/universal-bison-webhook`
3. **Edge function** processes:
   - Saves lead to `client_leads` table
   - Increments `interested_mtd` metric
   - Fetches Slack webhook URL from `client_registry`
   - Cleans reply text with OpenAI
   - Sends formatted notification to Slack
4. **Slack** receives and displays notification

### Current Status:
- ✅ Steps 1-3 working perfectly
- ⚠️ Step 4 going to wrong workspace

## Next Steps

   - Check test workspace T06R9MD2U2W (messages are there now)
   - OR update to Tony's production Slack

2. **If updating to production:**
   - Create new Slack webhook in Tony's workspace
   - Run update script with new URL
   - Test with a real lead

3. **Ongoing monitoring:**
   - Use `check-latest-webhook.ts` to monitor
   - Check `webhook_delivery_log` table for issues
   - Processing times > 1s = Slack is being called
