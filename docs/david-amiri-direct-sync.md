# David Amiri - Direct Email Bison Integration

## ✅ Completed

Successfully eliminated Airtable dependency and integrated David Amiri's leads directly from Email Bison API with complete lead data.

## What Was Built

### 1. Database Schema Enhancement

Added new fields to `client_leads` table:
- `title` - Job title (e.g., "Company Owner", "CEO")
- `company` - Company name
- `custom_variables` - JSON array of custom fields (e.g., savings amount, personalized lines)
- `tags` - JSON array of tags (e.g., "Outlook", "Proofpoint")
- `lead_status` - Lead verification status
- `lead_campaign_data` - Campaign-specific engagement data
- `overall_stats` - Overall engagement metrics (emails sent, opens, replies)

**Migration:** `supabase/migrations/MANUAL_RUN_add_lead_fields.sql`

### 2. Enhanced Sync Function

Updated `sync-bison-leads` to fetch complete lead data:

**Before:**
- Only extracted name/email from reply data
- Missing company, title, custom fields, tags

**After:**
- Fetches full lead details from `/api/leads/{id}`
- Caches lead data to avoid duplicate API calls
- Stores complete lead information including:
  - Contact info (name, email, phone, address)
  - Professional info (title, company)
  - Custom variables specific to each workspace
  - Tags for segmentation
  - Campaign engagement stats

**Function:** `supabase/functions/sync-bison-leads/index.ts`

### 3. Updated Portal UI

Enhanced lead cards to display:
- **Title** in blue text below name
- **Company name** in gray text
- **Tags** as purple badges (up to 3 shown)
- **Custom variables** as key-value pairs (first 2 shown)
- All original fields (email, phone, date, etc.)

**Component:** `src/pages/ClientPortalPage.tsx`

## David Amiri Sync Results

- **Workspace ID:** 25
- **Total Leads Synced:** 59
- **Time Period:** Last 120 days
- **Data Source:** Email Bison Positive Replies
- **Sync Status:** ✅ Complete

### Sample Lead Data

Each lead now includes:
```typescript
{
  first_name: "Moe",
  last_name: "Boukair",
  email: "moe@wccpainting.com",
  title: "Company Owner",
  company: "West Coast Commercial painting Inc.",
  custom_variables: [
    { name: "savings ammount", value: "6600" },
    { name: "personalized ps line", value: "P.S. I see you're the owner..." }
  ],
  tags: [
    { id: 196, name: "Proofpoint" }
  ],
  overall_stats: {
    emails_sent: 2,
    opens: 0,
    replies: 0
  }
}
```

## Access the Portal

1. Navigate to http://localhost:8082/client-portal
2. Click on "David Amiri" workspace
3. View all 59 leads with complete information
4. Drag and drop leads between pipeline stages
5. Click star icon to mark leads as interested

## No More Airtable Dependency!

✅ All lead data comes directly from Email Bison
✅ Custom fields are dynamically pulled per workspace
✅ Tags and engagement stats automatically synced
✅ Complete professional information (title, company)
✅ Real-time sync with "Sync from Bison" button

## Next Steps

1. **Test the portal:** Visit http://localhost:8082/client-portal/David%20Amiri
2. **Verify data:** Check that company names and titles are showing
3. **Check custom variables:** Confirm "savings amount" and other custom fields display
4. **Pipeline management:** Test drag-and-drop between stages
5. **Mark interested leads:** Use star icon to flag positive leads

## Rollout to Other Clients

The same enhanced sync will work for all other workspaces:
- Kim Wallace (already synced)
- John Roberts
- Danny Schwartz
- All 27 workspaces

Just click "Sync from Bison" on any workspace portal page!

## Technical Notes

- Lead data is cached during sync to avoid duplicate API calls
- Only fetches leads that have `lead_id` populated from replies
- Custom variables vary by workspace (each client has different fields)
- Tags help identify email provider types (Outlook, Proofpoint, etc.)
- Overall stats show engagement metrics per lead
