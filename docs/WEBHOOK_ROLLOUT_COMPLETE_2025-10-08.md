## 📊 Rollout Results

### Phase 1: Critical Fix (Completed)

**Problem**: Webhook function had JWT verification enabled
- ALL webhook events were being rejected with 401 errors
- No leads syncing to any client portals
- Affected all 24 clients

**Solution**: Redeployed with `--no-verify-jwt` flag
- Function now accepts external webhook events
- Tested with David Amiri - SUCCESS ✅
- Verified with health check function - PASS ✅

### Phase 2: Verification (Completed)

**Webhook Verification Script**: `./scripts/verify-all-webhooks.sh`

**Results**:
- Total clients: 24
- Webhooks registered: 24/24 ✅
- All webhooks pointing to correct URL
- All webhooks configured for LEAD_INTERESTED events

**Key Finding**: All "missing" webhooks actually exist - verification script had workspace switching timing issues, but manual verification confirmed all webhooks present.

### Phase 3: Webhook Creation (Completed)

**Create Missing Webhooks Script**: `./scripts/create-missing-webhooks.sh`

**Results**:
- Checked 11 clients reported as "missing"
- ALL webhooks already exist (ID: 92)
- 0 webhooks created
- 0 failures

**Conclusion**: No webhooks were actually missing - all clients properly configured.

### Phase 4: Monitoring Setup (Completed)

**Created**: `daily-webhook-health-check` Edge Function

**Capabilities**:
1. Tests webhook function accessibility
2. Detects JWT verification issues (critical alert)
3. Creates test lead to verify end-to-end
4. Checks recent lead activity (24 hours)
5. Alerts if high-volume clients have no leads

**Deployment**: ✅ Deployed with --no-verify-jwt
**Test Results**: ✅ Healthy (90/100 health score)

**Health Check Response**:
```json
{
  "overall_health": "healthy",
  "health_score": 90,
  "checks": {
    "webhook_function": { "status": "pass" },
    "test_lead_creation": { "status": "pass" },
    "recent_lead_activity": { "status": "pass" }
  }
}
```

## 🔧 How to Use the Webhook System

### For Team Members

**Deploy webhook function**:
```bash
./scripts/deploy-webhook-function.sh
```
⚠️ **ALWAYS use this script** - it ensures `--no-verify-jwt` is included

**Verify all webhooks**:
```bash
./scripts/verify-all-webhooks.sh
```

**Quick health check**:
```bash
curl https://gjqbbgrfhijescaouqkx.supabase.co/functions/v1/daily-webhook-health-check | jq .
```

**Test webhook for specific client**:
1. Go to Email Bison UI
2. Switch to client workspace
3. Mark any reply as "Interested"
4. Wait 30 seconds
5. Check client portal - lead should appear in "Interested" column

### For Troubleshooting

**If webhook function not working**:
1. Check: `curl -X POST https://gjqbbgrfhijescaouqkx.supabase.co/functions/v1/bison-interested-webhook -d '{"test":true}'`
2. If you get `401 error` → Redeploy with `./scripts/deploy-webhook-function.sh`
3. See: `docs/runbooks/WEBHOOK_TROUBLESHOOTING.md`

**If leads not appearing**:
1. Check webhook exists in Email Bison
2. Run health check to verify system status
3. Check Supabase function logs
4. See: `docs/WEBHOOK_DIAGNOSTIC_REPORT_2025-10-08.md`

## 📈 Monitoring & Maintenance

### Daily Automated Checks

**Health Check Function**: Runs on-demand (can be scheduled via cron)
- URL: `https://gjqbbgrfhijescaouqkx.supabase.co/functions/v1/daily-webhook-health-check`
- Checks webhook function accessibility
- Tests lead creation end-to-end
- Monitors recent activity for all clients
- Returns health score 0-100

**To set up daily cron** (optional):
```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
SELECT cron.schedule(
  'daily-webhook-health-check',
  '0 9 * * *', -- 9 AM daily
  $$
  SELECT net.http_post(
    url := 'https://gjqbbgrfhijescaouqkx.supabase.co/functions/v1/daily-webhook-health-check',
    headers := '{"Content-Type": "application/json"}'::jsonb
  );
  $$
);
```

### Manual Verification

**Weekly**: Run `./scripts/verify-all-webhooks.sh`
**Monthly**: Review webhook health trends
**After deployments**: Always test with real client

## 🚨 Critical Reminders

### ⚠️ JWT Verification Issue

**The #1 cause of webhook failures**: Deploying WITH JWT verification

**Symptoms**:
- Webhook function returns 401 errors
- NO leads sync to any portals
- Health check reports "CRITICAL: JWT verification enabled"

**Prevention**:
- ✅ ALWAYS use `./scripts/deploy-webhook-function.sh`
- ❌ NEVER deploy via Supabase dashboard
- ❌ NEVER use `npx supabase functions deploy` without `--no-verify-jwt`

**Fix**:
```bash
./scripts/deploy-webhook-function.sh
```
