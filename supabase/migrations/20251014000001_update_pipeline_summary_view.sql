-- =====================================================
-- UPDATE CONTACT PIPELINE SUMMARY VIEW
-- =====================================================
-- This migration updates the monthly_contact_pipeline_summary view to:
-- 1. Use clean_contact_target instead of monthly_contact_target
-- 2. Rename raw_contacts_uploaded â†’ total_raw_contacts
-- 3. Remove: deliverable_count, undeliverable_count, risky_count, contacts_uploaded, contacts_pending, hnw_contacts, target_percentage
-- 4. Add: added_to_campaign_count
-- 5. Update Gap calculation to use clean_contact_target
-- =====================================================

-- Drop existing view
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS public.monthly_contact_pipeline_summary CASCADE;

-- Create updated view with new column structure
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW public.monthly_contact_pipeline_summary AS

  vc.workspace_name,
  vc.month,

  -- Raw uploads (renamed to "total_raw_contacts")
  COUNT(DISTINCT rc.upload_batch_id) AS upload_batch_count,
  COUNT(rc.id) AS total_raw_contacts,  -- RENAMED from raw_contacts_uploaded

  -- Verification stats (simplified - removed breakdown)
  COUNT(vc.id) AS verified_contacts,

  -- Weekly batch tracking

  -- NEW: Count of batches added to campaign
  COUNT(DISTINCT wb.batch_id) FILTER (
    WHERE wb.bison_upload_status = 'added_to_campaign'
  ) AS added_to_campaign_count,

  -- Gap analysis (NEW: Based on clean_contact_target instead of monthly_contact_target)

  -- REMOVED COLUMNS (no longer in view):
  -- - deliverable_count (detailed verification breakdown not needed)
  -- - undeliverable_count (detailed verification breakdown not needed)
  -- - risky_count (detailed verification breakdown not needed)
  -- - contacts_uploaded (renamed to total_raw_contacts)
  -- - contacts_pending (no longer tracking pending separately)
  -- - hnw_contacts (HNW tracking moved to Kirk Hodgson's workspace)
  -- - target_percentage (removed Progress column from dashboard)
