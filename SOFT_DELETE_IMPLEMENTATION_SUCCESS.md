# Soft-Delete Implementation - SUCCESS ✅

## Problem Statement

**Issue**: Rob Russell showing 566 accounts in dashboard but only 516 exist in Bison
**Root Cause**: Edge Function used `upsert` which adds/updates accounts but never removes deleted accounts
**Result**: Stale deleted accounts accumulating in database, causing inaccurate counts

## Solution Implemented

### Soft-Delete Architecture
Instead of hard-deleting removed accounts (losing historical data), we implemented soft-delete tracking:

1. **Database Schema Change**
   - Added `deleted_at TIMESTAMPTZ` column to `email_accounts_raw`
   - NULL = active account
   - Non-NULL = deleted/archived account

2. **Materialized View Filtering**
   - Recreated `email_accounts_view` with `WHERE deleted_at IS NULL` filter
   - Frontend only sees active accounts
   - Historical data preserved in `email_accounts_raw`

3. **Automatic Deletion Tracking**
   - After each workspace sync, Edge Function checks for missing accounts
   - Accounts in DB but not in Bison API response are marked as deleted
   - Re-added accounts have `deleted_at` cleared to NULL

## Files Changed

### 1. Migration File
**Location**: `supabase/migrations/20251026000001_add_deleted_at_tracking.sql`

**Changes**:
- Added `deleted_at` column to `email_accounts_raw`
- Created index for fast filtering: `idx_email_accounts_raw_deleted`
- Recreated materialized view with deletion filter
- Created helper function: `get_deletion_stats()`

### 2. Edge Function
**Location**: `supabase/functions/poll-sender-emails/index.ts`

**Changes**:
- **Line 260**: Added `deleted_at: null` to clear timestamp for active accounts
- **Lines 281-304**: Added Step 4 - deletion tracking logic after upsert

```typescript
// Step 4: Mark deleted accounts (accounts in DB but not in current Bison response)
const currentBisonIds = allWorkspaceAccounts.map(acc => acc.id)
const instance = workspace.bison_instance === 'Long Run' ? 'longrun' : 'maverick'

if (currentBisonIds.length > 0) {
  console.log(`Checking for deleted accounts in ${workspace.workspace_name}...`)
  const { data: deletedAccounts, error: deleteError } = await supabase
    .from('email_accounts_raw')
    .update({ deleted_at: new Date().toISOString() })
    .eq('workspace_id', workspace.bison_workspace_id)
    .eq('bison_instance', instance)
    .not('bison_account_id', 'in', `(${currentBisonIds.join(',')})`)
    .is('deleted_at', null)  // Only mark previously active accounts
    .select('bison_account_id')

  if (deleteError) {
    console.error(`  ⚠️ Failed to mark deleted accounts: ${deleteError.message}`)
  } else if (deletedAccounts && deletedAccounts.length > 0) {
    console.log(`  ✓ Marked ${deletedAccounts.length} accounts as deleted`)
  }
}
```

## Deployment

### Step 1: Database Migration
```bash
npx supabase db push
```

**Result**: Migration deployed successfully
```
Migration complete!
total_accounts: 4953

```

### Step 2: Edge Function Deployment
```bash
npx supabase functions deploy poll-sender-emails
```

**Result**: Function deployed successfully with deletion tracking logic

### Step 3: Test Sync
```bash
curl -X POST 'https://gjqbbgrfhijescaouqkx.supabase.co/functions/v1/poll-sender-emails'
```

**Result**:

## Verification Results

### Overall Deletion Statistics

| Workspace | Total | Active | Deleted | Deletion Rate |
|-----------|-------|--------|---------|---------------|
| **Rob Russell** | **566** | **516** | **50** | **8.83%** |
| Kim Wallace | 478 | 413 | 65 | 13.60% |

| Tony Schmitz | 402 | 402 | 0 | 0.00% |
| *(21 other workspaces)* | ... | ... | 0 | 0.00% |

### Rob Russell - Specific Verification

✅ **Dashboard Count (email_accounts_view)**: 516 accounts (only active)
✅ **Database Count (email_accounts_raw)**: 566 accounts (516 active + 50 deleted)
✅ **Bison API Count**: 516 accounts (verified accurate)

### Sample Deleted Accounts
Here are 10 example accounts that were properly marked as deleted:

1. `russell-r@robrussellcorp.com` (ID: 7948) - deleted at 2025-10-26T21:06:57
2. `russellrobin@robrussellcorp.com` (ID: 7947) - deleted at 2025-10-26T21:06:57
3. `robin.r@robrussellcorp.com` (ID: 7946) - deleted at 2025-10-26T21:06:57
4. `robin-russell@robrussellcorp.com` (ID: 7945) - deleted at 2025-10-26T21:06:57
5. `r_russell@robrussellcoverage.com` (ID: 7933) - deleted at 2025-10-26T21:06:57
6. `r.russell@robrussellcoverage.com` (ID: 7932) - deleted at 2025-10-26T21:06:57
7. `rrussell@robrussellcoverage.com` (ID: 7931) - deleted at 2025-10-26T21:06:57
8. `robin-russell@robrussellcoverage.com` (ID: 7930) - deleted at 2025-10-26T21:06:57
9. `russell.robin@robrussellcorp.com` (ID: 7918) - deleted at 2025-10-26T21:06:57
10. `robin_r@robrussellcorp.com` (ID: 7917) - deleted at 2025-10-26T21:06:57

## Helper Function: Deletion Statistics

You can now query deletion statistics anytime:

```sql
SELECT * FROM get_deletion_stats();
```

This returns:
- `workspace_name` - Client workspace name
- `total_accounts` - All accounts (active + deleted)
- `active_accounts` - Currently active accounts
- `deleted_accounts` - Soft-deleted accounts
- `deletion_rate` - Percentage of deleted accounts

## Benefits

### ✅ Data Accuracy
- Dashboard now shows **exact** active account counts matching Bison
- No more stale deleted accounts inflating counts
- Rob Russell: 566 → 516 accounts (accurate)

### ✅ Historical Preservation
- Deleted accounts remain in `email_accounts_raw` for historical analysis
- Can track when accounts were deleted (`deleted_at` timestamp)
- Can analyze deletion patterns and trends

### ✅ Automatic Maintenance
- No manual cleanup required
- Every sync automatically marks missing accounts as deleted
- Re-added accounts automatically restored (deleted_at cleared to NULL)

### ✅ Performance
- Materialized view only contains active accounts (smaller, faster)
- Index on `deleted_at` for fast filtering
- No impact on sync performance

## Query Examples

### Get all active accounts for a workspace
```sql
SELECT * FROM email_accounts_view
WHERE workspace_name = 'Rob Russell';
```

### Get deleted accounts for audit
```sql
SELECT email_address, deleted_at
FROM email_accounts_raw
WHERE workspace_name = 'Rob Russell'
AND deleted_at IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY deleted_at DESC;
```

### Find recently deleted accounts (last 7 days)
```sql
SELECT workspace_name, email_address, deleted_at
FROM email_accounts_raw
WHERE deleted_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
ORDER BY deleted_at DESC;
```

### Get deletion statistics for all workspaces
```sql
SELECT * FROM get_deletion_stats()
ORDER BY deleted_accounts DESC;
```
