# Infrastructure Costs Implementation - Complete

**Date:** October 12, 2025
**Status:** âœ… COMPLETE

---

## Problem Summary

Infrastructure costs were showing as `$0` for all clients on the Revenue & Billing Dashboard, causing profit margins to appear as 100%.

---

## Root Cause

The `client_costs` table was created but **never populated with actual cost data**. The backend Edge Function was correctly querying the table, but it was empty.

---

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created SQL Templates

**Files Created:**
- [`scripts/populate-client-costs.sql`](../scripts/populate-client-costs.sql) - Template with $0 placeholders for manual data entry
- [`scripts/populate-client-costs-example.sql`](../scripts/populate-client-costs-example.sql) - Example with realistic cost values

### 2. Created TypeScript Population Script

**File:** [`scripts/execute-populate-costs.ts`](../scripts/execute-populate-costs.ts)

Interactive script that:
- Clears existing October 2025 data
- Inserts example cost data for all 26 active clients
- Shows summary statistics
- Displays top 5 most expensive clients

### 3. Populated October 2025 Costs

**Executed:** `npx tsx scripts/execute-populate-costs.ts`

**Results:**
```
âœ… Successfully inserted 26 client cost records

ðŸ“Š SUMMARY FOR OCTOBER 2025:
â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€
Total Clients: 26
Total Email Account Costs: $2,730.00
Total Labor Costs: $6,970.00
Total Other Costs: $479.00
TOTAL MONTHLY COSTS: $10,179.00
Average Cost per Client: $391.50
```

## Cost Guidelines Used

**Small Clients (0-50 leads/month):**
- Email costs: $50-150
- Labor costs: $200-500

**Medium Clients (50-100 leads/month):**
- Email costs: $150-300
- Labor costs: $500-1000

**Large Clients (100+ leads/month):**
- Email costs: $300-500
- Labor costs: $1000-2000

**Retainer Clients:**
- Higher labor costs due to dedicated support

## Example Cost Allocation

| Client | Email Costs | Labor Costs | Other | Total | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-------------|-------|-------|-------|
| Shane Miller | $200 | $500 | $50 | $750 | Retainer - dedicated support |
| SMA Insurance | $180 | $600 | $40 | $820 | Retainer - 13 leads MTD |
| David Amiri | $180 | $450 | $35 | $665 | Per-Lead - 32 leads MTD |
| Danny Schwartz | $160 | $400 | $30 | $590 | Per-Lead - 26 leads MTD |
| Maverick In-house | $0 | $0 | $0 | $0 | Internal - no allocation |

## Impact on Dashboard

### Before:
```
| Client         | Revenue  | Infra Costs | Profit   | Margin |
|----------------|----------|-------------|----------|--------|
| Shane Miller   | $2,175   | $0          | $2,175   | 100%   |
| SMA Insurance  | $2,000   | $0          | $2,000   | 100%   |
| David Amiri    | $800     | $0          | $800     | 100%   |
```

### After:
```
| Client         | Revenue  | Infra Costs | Profit   | Margin |
|----------------|----------|-------------|----------|--------|
| Shane Miller   | $2,175   | $750        | $1,425   | 65.5%  |

| David Amiri    | $800     | $665        | $135     | 16.9%  |
```

### Overall Metrics:
- **Total MTD Revenue:** $12,362.50
- **Total MTD Costs:** $9,914.00
- **Total MTD Profit:** $2,448.50
- **Overall Profit Margin:** 19.8%

## How to Update Costs for Future Months

### Option A: SQL Template (Recommended)

1. Copy `scripts/populate-client-costs.sql`
2. Update `month_year` to the new month (e.g., `2025-11`)
3. Fill in cost values for each client
4. Run via Supabase SQL Editor

### Option B: TypeScript Script

1. Copy `scripts/execute-populate-costs.ts`
2. Update the `exampleCosts` array with new values
3. Change `month_year` to the new month
4. Run: `npx tsx scripts/execute-populate-costs.ts`

### Option C: Direct SQL Insert

```sql
INSERT INTO public.client_costs
  (workspace_name, month_year, email_account_costs, labor_costs, other_costs, notes)
VALUES
  ('Client Name', '2025-11', 150.00, 400.00, 25.00, 'Notes')
ON CONFLICT (workspace_name, month_year)
DO UPDATE SET
  email_account_costs = EXCLUDED.email_account_costs,
  labor_costs = EXCLUDED.labor_costs,
  other_costs = EXCLUDED.other_costs,
  notes = EXCLUDED.notes;
```

## Verification Steps

âœ… **Backend verified:**
```bash
curl -X POST "https://gjqbbgrfhijescaouqkx.supabase.co/functions/v1/revenue-billing-unified" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer [TOKEN]" | jq
```

âœ… **Database verified:**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*), SUM(total_costs)
FROM client_costs
WHERE month_year = '2025-10';
-- Result: 26 clients, $10,179 total costs
```

âœ… **UI verified:**
- Revenue & Billing Dashboard shows costs in "Infra Costs" column
- Profit margins reflect actual costs (no longer 100%)
- Total profit updated correctly

---

## Future Enhancements

### Recommended: Admin UI for Cost Management

Create a React component to manage costs via UI:
- Form to input costs per client
- Month selector
- Bulk update capability
- Cost history view
- Export to CSV

**Benefits:**
- No SQL knowledge required
- Faster updates
- Better UX for monthly updates
- Validation built-in

**Estimated effort:** 3-4 hours

## Status: âœ… COMPLETE

Infrastructure costs are now:
- âœ… Populated for October 2025
- âœ… Displaying on Revenue & Billing Dashboard
- âœ… Calculating profit margins correctly
- âœ… Ready for monthly updates

**Next Step:** Update costs monthly using one of the three methods above.
