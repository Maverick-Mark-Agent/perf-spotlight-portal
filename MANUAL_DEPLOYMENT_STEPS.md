# Manual Deployment Steps

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Issue: Changes Pushed but Not Deployed

Your code changes have been successfully pushed to GitHub (`main` branch), but they haven't been deployed to production yet.

---

## üîç Why This Happened

**The GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) is a placeholder** - it doesn't actually deploy to any hosting provider. It only:
1. Builds the project
2. Shows a message: "Deploy step - configure based on hosting provider"

**This means:** Vercel is likely configured separately in the Vercel dashboard, but the auto-deployment may not be working or may need to be triggered manually.

## üöÄ Solution: Manual Deployment Options

### **Option 1: Vercel Dashboard (RECOMMENDED)**

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard:**
   ```
   https://vercel.com/dashboard
   ```

2. **Find your project:**
   - Look for "perf-spotlight-portal" in your projects list

3. **Trigger a manual deployment:**
   - Click on the project
   - Go to "Deployments" tab
   - Click "Redeploy" button
   - Select "main" branch
   - Click "Deploy"

4. **Wait for deployment** (2-3 minutes)

5. **Test the live URL** to verify Shane Miller shows 444 accounts

---

### **Option 2: Vercel CLI (If you have access)**

**Install Vercel CLI:**
```bash
npm install -g vercel
```

**Login to Vercel:**
```bash
vercel login
```

**Link project:**
```bash
vercel link
```

**Deploy to production:**
```bash
vercel --prod
```

---

### **Option 3: Force GitHub Action (If configured in Vercel)**

**Check Vercel Project Settings:**

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Click your project ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Git
3. Ensure "Production Branch" is set to `main`
4. Ensure "Auto-Deploy" is enabled

**If Auto-Deploy is enabled:**
- Vercel should automatically detect the push
- Check "Deployments" tab for status
- May take 2-5 minutes

**If Auto-Deploy is NOT enabled:**
- Enable it in Settings ‚Üí Git
- Or use Option 1 (Manual Redeploy)

---

### **Option 4: Commit an Empty Change (Trigger Auto-Deploy)**

If auto-deploy is configured but didn't trigger:

```bash
# Create empty commit to trigger deployment
git commit --allow-empty -m "chore: trigger deployment"
git push origin main
```

This will create a new commit that triggers Vercel's auto-deployment.

---

## üß™ Verification After Deployment

Once deployed, verify:

1. **Open your live dashboard URL**
   ```
   https://your-production-url.vercel.app/email-accounts
   ```

2. **Check Shane Miller:**
   - Should show **444 accounts** (not 505)

3. **Check Total:**
   - Should show **~4,111 accounts** (not 4,234)

4. **Open Console (F12):**
   ```javascript
   ‚úÖ [DEDUPLICATION COMPLETE] Removed 123 duplicates
   ‚úÖ [FINAL COUNT] 4111 unique accounts
   ```

## üìä Quick Check: Is Vercel Connected?

**Check these:**

1. **Vercel Dashboard:**
   - Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
   - Do you see "perf-spotlight-portal" project?
   - Click it and check latest deployment

2. **GitHub Repository:**
   - Go to https://github.com/Maverick-Mark-Agent/perf-spotlight-portal
   - Click "Settings" ‚Üí "Integrations"
   - Is "Vercel" listed?

3. **Latest Commit:**
   - Check if commit `b1ad472` appears in Vercel's "Deployments" tab
   - If not, deployment wasn't triggered

---

## üö® If Deployment Still Doesn't Work

### **Possible Issues:**

1. **Vercel not connected to GitHub repo**
   - Solution: Reconnect in Vercel dashboard

2. **Auto-deploy disabled**
   - Solution: Enable in Vercel project settings

3. **Wrong branch configured**
   - Solution: Set production branch to `main`

4. **Build errors**
   - Solution: Check deployment logs in Vercel

5. **Network/permissions issues**
   - Solution: Check Vercel account permissions

---

## üìù Alternative: Check Current Deployment

**What's currently deployed?**

1. Visit your live dashboard
2. Open browser console (F12)
3. Run this:
   ```javascript
   // Check git commit hash (if exposed)
   console.log(window.location.href);

   // Check if new code is deployed
   // Look for this log message (only exists in new code):
   console.log('Checking for: üöÄüöÄüöÄ [REALTIME SERVICE]');
   ```

If you see `üöÄüöÄüöÄ [REALTIME SERVICE]` in logs ‚Üí **New code IS deployed**
If you don't see it ‚Üí **Old code still running**

---

## ‚úÖ Next Steps

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard:** https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. **Find your project:** perf-spotlight-portal
3. **Click "Redeploy"** on latest commit (`b1ad472`)
4. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for deployment
5. **Test live dashboard** to verify Shane Miller = 444
