# Devin Hodo Lead Sync - Verified Solution Documentation

**Date:** October 9, 2025
**Status:** ✅ Verified and Working
**Email Bison Leads:** 42
**Database Leads:** 42
**Match:** Perfect ✓

---

## Executive Summary

Successfully synced all 42 interested leads from Email Bison to the client portal for Devin Hodo. The sync process accurately:
- ✅ Pulls ONLY interested leads (filtered by `status=interested`)
- ✅ Creates working conversation URLs (`https://send.maverickmarketingllc.com/leads/{lead_id}`)
- ✅ Fetches full lead details (email, phone, tags, custom_variables)
- ✅ Matches Email Bison's count exactly (42 leads)

---

## Technical Solution

### Email Bison API Endpoints Used

1. **Get Interested Replies**
   ```bash
   GET /api/replies?status=interested&per_page=100
   ```
   - Returns replies marked as "interested"
   - Includes `lead_id` for each reply
   - Pagination support (100 per page)

2. **Get Full Lead Details**
   ```bash
   GET /api/leads/{lead_id}
   ```
   - Returns complete lead information
   - Fields: email, first_name, last_name, title, company
   - Arrays: custom_variables, tags

### Conversation URL Format

**Correct Format:**
```
https://send.maverickmarketingllc.com/leads/{lead_id}
```

**Example:**
```
https://send.maverickmarketingllc.com/leads/632586
```

**Note:** URLs return HTTP 302 redirect when accessed via API (requires browser authentication). This is **expected behavior** - the URL format is correct.

    A[Start Sync] --> B[Query Email Bison API]
    B --> C[Get Interested Replies]
    C --> D[For Each Reply]
    D --> E[Extract lead_id]
    E --> F[Fetch Full Lead Details]
    F --> G[Extract Phone from Custom Vars]

    H --> I[Upsert to Database]
    I --> J{More Replies?}
    J -->|Yes| D
    J -->|No| K[Sync Complete]
```

### Step-by-Step Process:

1. **Query Email Bison** for interested replies
2. **Extract lead_id** from each reply
3. **Fetch full lead details** using workspace-specific API key
4. **Extract phone number** from custom_variables array
5. **Construct conversation URL** using lead_id
6. **Upsert to database** (prevents duplicates)
7. **Verify count** matches Email Bison

## How to Refresh Browser After Sync

**The frontend uses React Query caching.** After a sync, you need to hard refresh:

- **Mac:** `Cmd + Shift + R`
- **Windows/Linux:** `Ctrl + Shift + R`

This clears the React Query cache and fetches fresh data from the database.

## Verification Checklist

✅ Email Bison count: **42 interested leads**
✅ Database count: **42 interested leads**
✅ Conversation URLs: **Correct format** (https://send.maverickmarketingllc.com/leads/{lead_id})
✅ Lead data fields: **Phone, tags, custom_variables populated**
✅ URL accessibility: **HTTP 302 (expected - requires auth in browser)**
✅ Sync duration: **15 seconds**

---

## Next Steps

**Ready to apply to remaining 23 clients:**

1. Run sync for all clients
2. Verify counts match Email Bison
3. Check sample leads for each workspace
4. Hard refresh browser to see fresh data

**Sync command:**
```bash
curl -X POST "https://gjqbbgrfhijescaouqkx.supabase.co/functions/v1/sync-client-pipeline" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SUPABASE_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{}' # Empty body syncs all clients
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Database shows more leads than Email Bison
**Cause:** Historical data - leads that were previously interested but status changed
**Solution:** Clear database and re-sync fresh (as done for Devin Hodo)

### Issue: URLs return 404
**Expected Behavior:** URLs require browser authentication
**Solution:** URLs are correct - HTTP 302/404 via API is normal

### Issue: Phone number missing
**Cause:** Phone stored in custom_variables, not direct field
**Solution:** Sync function extracts from custom_variables array

### Issue: Browser shows old data
**Cause:** React Query caching
**Solution:** Hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R / Ctrl+Shift+R)
