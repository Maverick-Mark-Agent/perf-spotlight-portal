### 2. Positive Replies (tblUz8inqzWcWWTZY)

**Purpose**: Individual positive reply/lead records. Each record = 1 positive reply from a prospect.

**Key Fields**:
- `Lead Email` - Prospect email address
- `First Name` / `Last Name` - Prospect name
- `Date Received` - When reply was received
- `Reply Received` - Text of the reply
- `Email Sent` - Original email sent to prospect
- `Email Subject` - Subject line
- `Client` - Link to Clients table (which client this lead belongs to)
- `Client Name (from Client)` - Lookup of client name
- `Campaign Linked` - Link to campaign that generated this lead
- `Lead Value` - Estimated value (typically $500)
- `Workspace Name` - Email Bison workspace
- `Lead ID` - ID from Email Bison
- `State` / `City` / `ZIP` / `Address` - Lead location data
- `Received - MTD` - Checkbox/formula: Is this lead from current month-to-date?
- `Received - Last 7 Days` - Is this lead from last 7 days?
- `Last VS This Month` - Was this lead from current or previous month?
- `Previous 14-7 Days` - Was this lead from 14-7 days ago?

**How It Works**:
- Each time a positive reply is detected in Email Bison, a new record is created here
- The `Client` link field connects it to the client
- The `Positive Replies MTD` count field in Clients table counts records where `Received - MTD` = "‚úÖ YES"
- Similar count fields filter by date ranges

## Field Naming Conventions

### Identified Patterns

**Count Fields**:
- Format: `[Metric Name]` - Example: `Positive Replies MTD`
- Type: Count field that counts linked records with specific filters
- Always returns integer

**Formula Fields (Calculated)**:
- Progress: Returns decimal (0.75 = 75%) or percentage directly
- Projections: Returns integer (projected count)
- Comparisons: Returns percentage as decimal or number

**Lookup Fields**:
- Format: `[Field Name] (from [Table Name])` - Example: `Client Name (from Client)`

**Rollup Fields**:
- Aggregate data from linked records

### Time Period Naming

| Pattern | Meaning | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| MTD | Month-to-Date (calendar month, day 1 to today) | `Positive Replies MTD` |
| Current Month | Same as MTD | `Positive Replies Current Month` |
| Last Month | Previous calendar month (full month) | `Positive Replies Last Month` |
| Last X Days | Rolling X-day window from today | `Positive Replies Last 30 Days` |
| Last 14-7 Days | Days 14-7 ago (week before last week) | `Positive Replies Last 14-7 Days` |

## Data Relationships

### Primary Flow: Client ‚Üí Positive Replies

```
üë®‚Äçüíª Clients (Master)
    ‚Üì (one-to-many)
üì® Positive Replies (Individual leads)
    ‚Üë (count fields with filters)
üë®‚Äçüíª Clients (MTD, Last 7 Days, etc.)
```

**How Count Fields Work**:
1. Clients table has linked record field `Positive Replies` pointing to Positive Replies table
2. Positive Replies table has formula fields like `Received - MTD` that return "‚úÖ YES" or "‚ùå NO"
3. Clients table has count fields that count linked replies where `Received - MTD` = "‚úÖ YES"
4. This gives real-time counts based on date filters

### Infrastructure Flow

```
üë®‚Äçüíª Clients
    ‚Üì
üìß Email Accounts ‚Üí Warmy Reports (health data)
üåê Domains
```

### Campaign Flow

```
üë®‚Äçüíª Clients
    ‚Üì
üìä Campaigns Performance
    ‚Üì
üì® Positive Replies (linked to campaigns)
```

## Critical Insights for Dashboard Integration

### KPI Dashboard Uses:
1. **Primary Field**: `Positive Replies MTD` (count field, auto-updates)
2. **Target**: `Monthly KPI` (manual input)
3. **Progress**: `MTD - Leads Generated Progress` (formula, returns decimal 0-1)
4. **Projection**: `Projection: Positive Replies Received (by EOM)` (formula)

### Volume Dashboard Uses:
1. **Target**: `Monthly Sending Target`
2. **Actual**: `Emails Sent - MTD (Linked to Campaigns)` or Email Bison API
3. **Today**: `Today Volume` or Email Bison API

### Billing Dashboard Uses:
1. **Retainer**: `Retainer`
2. **Performance Payout**: `Payout`
3. **KPI Achievement**: `Positive Replies MTD` / `Monthly KPI`

## Data Quality Considerations

### Known Issues

**Issue 1: MTD vs Current Month Confusion**
- Both `Positive Replies MTD` and `Positive Replies Current Month` exist
- **MTD** = "Month to Date" (should reset on 1st of month)
- **Current Month** = Current calendar month
- In theory they should be identical, but we've seen discrepancies
- **Recommendation**: Use `Positive Replies MTD` as it's more likely to reset properly

**Issue 2: Rolling vs Calendar Windows**
- "Last 30 Days" is a ROLLING 30-day window
- "Current Month" is CALENDAR month (Sept 1-30, Oct 1-31, etc.)
- Be careful not to mix these in comparisons

**Issue 3: Count Field Dependencies**
- Count fields depend on formula fields in the Positive Replies table
- If those formulas break or date logic is wrong, counts will be wrong
- Always verify the underlying `Received - MTD` type fields in Positive Replies

### Recommended Validations

1. **Monthly Reset Check**: On 1st of each month, verify MTD fields reset to 0
2. **Cross-Reference**: Compare Airtable counts to Email Bison API counts
3. **Date Logic Audit**: Review all date-based formulas in Positive Replies table
4. **Missing Links**: Check for clients in Email Bison but not in Airtable (orphaned data)

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Schema documented
2. ‚è≥ Review and fix date formulas in Positive Replies table
3. ‚è≥ Standardize field mappings in Edge Functions
4. ‚è≥ Create field-to-dashboard mapping guide
5. ‚è≥ Set up monthly data validation automation
