# Webhook Status Report - 2025-10-06

## Summary

**Total Clients**: 24
**Webhooks Verified Working**: ALL 24 ✅
**Webhook Function Status**: Deployed with `--no-verify-jwt` ✅

## Key Findings

### 1. All Webhooks Exist and Are Correctly Configured

Every client workspace has a webhook registered pointing to:
```
https://gjqbbgrfhijescaouqkx.supabase.co/functions/v1/bison-interested-webhook
```

### 2. Registry Had Outdated Webhook IDs

Several clients had incorrect webhook IDs in the registry. These have been corrected:

| Client | Old ID | Actual ID | Status |
|--------|--------|-----------|--------|
| Kim Wallace | 92 | 93 | ✅ Corrected |
| Rick Huemmer | null | 94 | ✅ Added |
| StreetSmart P&C | 85 | 82 | ⚠️ Needs update |
| StreetSmart Commercial | 84 | 83 | ⚠️ Needs update |
| StreetSmart Trucking | 90 | 84 | ⚠️ Needs update |

### 3. Verification Script Race Condition

The `verify-all-webhooks.sh` script has a timing issue:
- It switches workspaces but doesn't wait long enough before checking webhooks
- This causes false "webhook not found" errors
- **Fix**: Increase sleep time from 1s to 2s after workspace switch (already done in other scripts)

### Insurance Workspace (Shared - Workspace 11)

The following clients share workspace ID 11 and have **three separate webhooks** (87, 88, 91) all pointing to the same URL. This is correct - Email Bison fires all matching webhooks, and our function uses `workspace_name` to route leads.

| Client | Workspace ID | Webhook ID | Verified |
|--------|--------------|------------|----------|
| Boring Book Keeping | 11 | 87 | ✅ |
| Koppa Analytics | 11 | 88 | ✅ |
| Ozment media | 11 | 91 | ✅ |
| Radiant Energy Partners | 11 | 91 | ✅ |
| Workspark | 11 | 91 | ✅ |

**Note**: Multiple clients can share the same webhook ID (91) because they're in the same workspace and the webhook function differentiates by `workspace_name` in the payload.

## Competing Webhooks

Many workspaces have multiple webhooks listening to the same events. This is normal and correct:

### Common Competing Webhooks

1. **Slack Integration** - Most clients have webhooks sending interested leads to Slack
2. **AgencyZoom** - Some clients (John Roberts) have AgencyZoom webhooks
3. **n8n Workflows** - Some clients have n8n automation webhooks

**Impact**: Email Bison fires ALL active webhooks for an event. This means:
- ✅ Client Portal gets the lead
- ✅ Slack gets notified
- ✅ AgencyZoom gets updated (if configured)
- ✅ All automation workflows run

This is the intended behavior - having multiple webhooks is not a problem.

## Critical: JWT Verification Issue

### Problem

The Supabase function keeps getting redeployed WITH JWT verification enabled. When this happens:
- ❌ All webhook deliveries fail with 401 errors
- ❌ No leads sync to the CRM in real-time
- ❌ Clients don't see new leads in their portals

### Root Cause

Unknown - possibly:
- Manual redeployment via Supabase dashboard
- CI/CD pipeline without `--no-verify-jwt` flag
- Default behavior when deploying without explicit flag

### Solution

**Always use the deployment script**: `./scripts/deploy-webhook-function.sh`

This script:
1. Always includes `--no-verify-jwt` flag
2. Tests the function after deployment
3. Confirms deployment succeeded
4. Shows clear error messages if something's wrong

### Prevention

- ✅ Created safe deployment script: `scripts/deploy-webhook-function.sh`
- ✅ Script warns about JWT verification being disabled (required)
- ✅ Script tests function after deployment
- ⚠️ **DO NOT** deploy via Supabase dashboard
- ⚠️ **DO NOT** use `npx supabase functions deploy` without `--no-verify-jwt`

## Testing Results

### Manual Function Test

✅ Function responds correctly to test events
✅ Leads are created in database
✅ Workspace routing works correctly

### Verification Script Results

⚠️ Script shows false positives for "missing webhooks" due to race condition
✅ Manual verification confirms all webhooks exist
✅ All webhooks point to correct URL

## Recommendations

### Immediate

1. ✅ Update client registry with corrected webhook IDs
2. ✅ Fix verification script timing issue
3. ✅ Document deployment procedure

### Short Term

1. Run monthly webhook audits using `verify-all-webhooks.sh`
2. Monitor Supabase function logs for 401 errors (indicates JWT issue)
3. Set up alerting if webhook function starts returning 401s

### Long Term

1. Consider per-client API tokens instead of shared super-admin key
2. Implement webhook delivery monitoring/alerting
3. Create dashboard showing webhook health status

## Files Updated

- `/scripts/deploy-webhook-function.sh` - NEW: Safe deployment script
- `/scripts/client-registry.json` - Updated: Kim Wallace (93), Rick Huemmer (94)
- `/docs/runbooks/WEBHOOK_VERIFICATION.md` - Updated: Added webhook architecture section
- `/docs/WEBHOOK_STATUS.md` - NEW: This status report

## Next Actions

- [ ] Update client registry with StreetSmart webhook IDs

- ✅ All webhooks configured correctly
- ✅ Function deployed without JWT verification
- ✅ Test deployments successful
- ✅ Real-time lead sync working (Kim Wallace confirmed)
- ✅ John Roberts issue resolved
