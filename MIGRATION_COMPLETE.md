# ✅ Airtable to Supabase Migration - COMPLETE

**Migration Date:** October 7, 2025
**Status:** Successfully Completed
**Dashboards:** Fully Operational on Supabase

---

## 🎉 What Was Accomplished

### Phase 1: Database Schema ✅
- Created `client_metrics` table for time-series KPI data
- Created `campaigns` table for campaign tracking
- Added `monthly_sending_target` and `payout` columns to `client_registry`
- Created `client_dashboard_data` view for combined queries
- Added helper functions for metrics management

### Phase 2: Data Migration ✅
- Migrated 21 active clients from Airtable to `client_registry`
- Synced 27 workspaces from Email Bison to `client_metrics`
- All client data validated and confirmed accurate

### Phase 3: Edge Function Updates ✅
- `hybrid-workspace-analytics` → 100% Supabase (no Airtable)
- `volume-dashboard-data` → 100% Supabase (no Airtable)
- `send-volume-slack-dm` → 100% Supabase (no Airtable)
- All functions deployed and tested successfully

### Phase 4: Frontend Testing ✅
- Local dev server running without errors
- All dashboard routes returning 200 OK:
  - KPI Dashboard (/kpi) ✓
  - Billing Dashboard (/billing) ✓
  - Volume Dashboard (/volume) ✓
- No console errors or warnings

## 📝 Remaining Tasks

### 1. Setup Daily Cron Job (RECOMMENDED)
Run `sync-all-metrics` function daily at 3 AM to keep metrics fresh:

```sql
-- Add to Supabase cron jobs
SELECT cron.schedule(
  'sync-all-metrics-daily',
  '0 3 * * *', -- 3 AM daily
  $$
  SELECT net.http_post(
    url := 'https://gjqbbgrfhijescaouqkx.supabase.co/functions/v1/sync-all-metrics',
    headers := jsonb_build_object(
      'Authorization', 'Bearer YOUR_ANON_KEY',
      'Content-Type', 'application/json'
    )
  );
  $$
);
```

### 2. Monitor for 7 Days
- Check dashboards daily to ensure data accuracy
- Verify that metrics update correctly
- Compare with Airtable if needed (keep as backup)

### 3. Remove Airtable (After 30 Days)
Once you're confident everything works:
- Archive Airtable base (don't delete yet)
- Remove `AIRTABLE_API_KEY` from Supabase secrets
- Delete old Airtable-dependent functions (if any remain)

## ⚙️ Technical Details

### New Database Tables

#### `client_registry`
- Source of truth for all clients
- Contains: KPI targets, pricing, sending targets, payout
- Updated from: One-time Airtable migration

#### `client_metrics`
- Time-series data (daily snapshots)
- Contains: MTD emails, replies, projections
- Updated from: Daily `sync-all-metrics` function

#### `campaigns`
- Campaign scheduling data
- Ready for future use

### Key Scripts

#### One-Time Migration
- `scripts/populate-client-registry.mjs` - Sync Airtable → Supabase

#### Daily Sync
- `sync-all-metrics` Edge Function - Email Bison → Supabase

## 🚨 Important Notes

1. **Payout Calculation**: Currently uses `client_registry.payout` which was calculated from Airtable. This should be updated periodically or calculated dynamically.

2. **Positive Replies**: Currently showing 0 because `client_leads` table needs leads marked with `interested = true`. This is populated from your lead sync process.

3. **Monthly Sending Target**: Formula used: `3-Day Average × 26` (matching Airtable).

4. **Backup**: Airtable data is still available as a backup. Do NOT delete until you're 100% confident.
