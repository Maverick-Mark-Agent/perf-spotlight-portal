-- ADD SOFT-DELETE TRACKING TO EMAIL ACCOUNTS
-- ============================================================================
-- Purpose: Track deleted accounts without losing historical data
-- Date: 2025-10-26
-- ============================================================================

-- Add deleted_at column to track soft deletes
ALTER TABLE public.email_accounts_raw
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS deleted_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NULL;

-- Create index for fast filtering of active accounts
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_email_accounts_raw_deleted
ON public.email_accounts_raw(deleted_at)
WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;

-- Add comment explaining the column
COMMENT ON COLUMN public.email_accounts_raw.deleted_at IS
'Timestamp when account was detected as deleted from Bison. NULL = active account, non-NULL = deleted/archived account';

-- ============================================================================
-- UPDATE MATERIALIZED VIEW TO FILTER DELETED ACCOUNTS
-- ============================================================================

-- Drop existing view
DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW IF EXISTS public.email_accounts_view CASCADE;

-- Recreate view with deleted_at filter
